1. Command Syntax Options: rm -r Module_6

In Module_4, the command rm -r has two fucntions. 
The rm stands for "remove"; removal of the specified file name in the directory: rm Module_6. 
The rm -r stands for "repeat" of removal of both files and there matching directories: rm -r Module_6. 

For instance if I want to remove the file and all of it's contents:
I would use rm -r Module_6. I could now run ls and see that Module_6 is no longer on the command line.

2. Operating System

Linux is an open-source operating system based on the Linux kernel. 

Linux's distribution is the operating system that is made of the kernel, GNU tools, software, and package managers. 
Many individuals and compainies work on different parts of Linux.

Open-source refers to a community developed and community supported hardware or software project. For example: a 
Raspberry Pi 4 would be the hardware, and it's operating system could be any variant of any Linux distro, but mainly Raspberry Pi OS.

Typically, the phrase open-source means that the technology is free to use, share, modify for all. 

3. Programming Languages

It is said that there may be more than 700 to 9000 programming languages. There are so many programming languages, because of the way 
they are to be used for there speciefic job. 

Not all programming languages are designed for all industries. Many jobs in different industries have their specific coding
languages. Different industires use different requirements for the job task at hand. The jobs could be very complex such as a jelly bean counter
and as simplified as an automatic aresol sprayer.

Part 2

The UCLA boot camp's cybersecurity program is going to be a good and healthy challenge for me. My goal is to start a private cybersecurity home 
business, and work remote from anywhere. I also am interested in some possible travel as a Pen Tester. For the last decade I have been building and 
trouble shooting, smart phones, notebooks, personal computers, and there networks. Most networks I work on were basic and turn key. I want to step 
out of my comfort zone and branch out to help build a more fruitful career. The cybersecurity field is in trouble and in need of good help. I do not 
want to watch this country of ours suffer any more due to the lack of computer security knowledge of personal, small, or large businesse's. The 
foreign and domestic hackers have made me want to do more then just stand by as a spectator.
